    This contains all wiki page UI contents inside of nested BoxContainers.
    Each root-level BoxContainer inside of the "Contents" BoxContainer must be named something relating to their contents
        and end in "Contents".
    The wiki contents Name must be the exact same as the button Name (with the added "Contents" only to the contents)
        if the names do not match, the UI will fail to find the page.
    I recommend avoiding adding Names to things other than the root container unless you know what you are doing,
        and plan on doing something code-wise with it.

    If you wish to do something code-wise with the content, make a new xaml element somewhere and put the code with it.
        I do not want there to be a bunch of random xaml and cs within the main files of this wiki.
        You can probably find examples somewhere in the humanoid editor, lots of this was taken from there.
